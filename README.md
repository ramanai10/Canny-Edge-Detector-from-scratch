# Canny-Edge-Detector-from-scratch
#This code is based on the steps of Canny Edge Dtector:
#i) Convert image to Grayscale and creation of the Gaussian Kernel
#ii) Noise Elimination and Image Smoothing: Gaussian Blur
#iii) Gradient magnitude and angle calculation using Sobel Filter
#iv) Estimating the direction of pixels using Non-maximum suppression
#v) Double thresolding and hysteresis
